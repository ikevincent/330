    <h1>Week 7 Readings</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 11: Further Functions</h2>
    <p>"functions are first-class objects, which means they can be passed around in the same way as every other value.
        They can have their own properties and methods, as well as accepting other functions as parameters and being
        returned by other functions."</p>
    <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of 'this' inside a function to an object that is provided as the
        first argument.</p>
    <p>You can add custom properties to functions. The example given is a description property to describe what the
        function does.</p>
    <p>IIFE - pronounced 'iffy' is an Immediately Invoked Function Expression</p>
    <p>Because they're immediately invoked you have to create the function when you place your () to invoke a function.
    </p>
    <p>By doing this you avoid cluttering the global namespace. Good for when you know you'll only need a short function
        once.</p>
    <p>Note to self: study recursive functions further.</p>
    <p>Event-driven Asynchronous Programming. You can create a callback based on events like running a callback that
        executes after a certain amount of time.</p>
    <p>Spaghetti code is when more than one callback is used in the same function, resulting in a large number of nested
        blocks that are difficult to comprehend.</p>
    <p>This is referred to as "Callback Hell."</p>
    <p>Note to self: study closures further. I don't get it at all.</p>

    <h2>Chaper 13: Ajax</h2>
    <p>Ajax allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server. This enables data to be sent and received in
        the background.</p>
    <p>Ajax = Asynchronous JavaScript XML</p>
    <p>Fetch API. The fetch method has one argument which is the url of the data you want.</p>
    <p>You then handle the code with '.then' and use '.catch' to handle any errors. </p>
    <p>When you run the code you check if the response is ok and then throw an error if not with an if block.</p>
    <p>I've worked with fetch before but it's been a while and I need more practice with the different parts of it. I am
        going to work through the quiz ninja project and then upload when it's been completed.</p>
