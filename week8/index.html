    <h1>Week 8 Readings</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    <p>CSS3 Trasform lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</p>
    <p>You can use more than one function by seperating each of them with a space in the order you want the functions
        applied.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Translate: Move elements left, right, up, or down.</li>
        <li>Rotate: Rotate an element by any degree.</li>
        <li>Scale: Change the horizontal and veritical scale of an element.</li>
        <li>Skew: Skew an element by a certain degree on the x and y axis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Transitions allow values of CSS properties to change over time. Creating short "animations."</p>
    <p>You can set the property (such as transform), duration, timing, and delay.</p>
    <p>Keyframes allow you to create the rule that your desired animation will follow.</p>
    <p>You tell the keyframe where it will start and how it will finish and call the name of your animation at the start
        to apply it to your animation.</p>
    <h2>Chaper 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
    <p>Canvas is essentially a space where you can draw or create directly on the webpage through their special API.
        It's like having a whiteboard on the website. You can draw any shape through your CSS on your canvas.</p>
    <p>I'm curious about common applications for canvases on websites. I can't really think of any right now but I'm
        sure they're pretty common?</p>
    <p>I've used SVG's a little but I'm still don't feel super confident with them.</p>
    <p>Note: Seek out SVG activities and demos this week.</p>
    <p>Canvas vs SVG: From the textbook: In summary, if you need to paint pixels to the screen and have no concerns
        about the ability to retrieve and modify your shapes, canvas is probably the better choice. If, on the other
        hand, you need to be able to access and change specific aspects of your graphics, SVG might be more appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>Drag and Drop: You can use this API to specificy elements that can be dragged and dropped on your website.</p>
    <p>You designate the draggable elements and then make sure that you also designate where they can be dropped to add interactivity to a website.</p>
