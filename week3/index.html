    <h1>Week 3 Readings</h1>
    <h2>Object Methods: this</h2>
    <p>Objects typically represent real world entities like users and orders.</p>
    <p>Actions those users make are represented by functions in properties.</p>
    <p>"A function that is a property of an object is called its method."</p>
    <p>When methods need info that is stored in the object you use "this" followed by a dot, and then the item from within the object.</p>
    <p>'this' can be used in any function. It's always evaluated during run-time and it can apply to more than one object.</p>
    <h2>Chapter 5: Objects</h2>
    <p>In this chapter, the object discussed are the attributes of Superman but objects can be any collection of relative values.</p>
    <p>This is mostly review but these are the important aspects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An Object Literal is just an object created directly in the language.</li>
        <li>Objects contain key-value pairs.</li>
        <li>It can also contain methods.</li>
        <li>You can create objects by creating a const and adding curly braces.</li>
        <li>If the property key and the variable name it's assigned to are identical you can use a shorthand in ES6 and only write it once.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use dot notation to call a method from within an object. Like "superman.fly()" to call the fly method from the Superman object.</p>
    <p>You can check if properties exist within an object and you can also find all the properties of a object. <em>What is that most commonly used for?</em></p>
    <p>You can nest objects within an object and then drill down in order to retrieve properties of the nested objects.</p>
    <p>A namespace helps prevent naming collisions when you reuse variable names. This typically comes up in larger projects or collaborations.</p>
    <p>JSON is a string representation of objects and it's lightweight. Use the parse method to return a javaScript object from a JSON string.</p>
    <p>Other built-in objects of note:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Math - Contains various methods for common mathematic operations</li>
        <li>Date - Contains info about date and time.</li>
        <li>RegEx - Searches for strings that match a specified pattern.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 6: DOM</h2>
    <p>DOM or Document Object Model represents the html as a network of connected nodes with a heirarchy.</p>
    <p>You can use the DOM to retrieve certain aspects of the webpage.</p>
    <p>You can search or get elements by tag, class, or id.</p>
    <p><em>Why do you need to set the attributes of elements?</em></p>
    <h2>Chapter 7: Events</h2>
    <p>Each time a user interacts with the web page, events happen as they do different things.</p>
    <p>Common Event Types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mouse Events: click, mousedown, mouseup, doubleclick, mouseover, mouseout</li>
        <li>Keyboard Events: keydown, keyup, keypress</li>
        <li>Touch Events (on phones): touchstart, touchend, touchenter, touchleave, touchcancel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using click is sometimes still better on mobile devices because there is a slight delay whereas touch events are instantaneous</p>
    <p>You can use preventDefault() to change the default behavior but you have to be careful because users will expect certain things on a web page.</p>
    <p>To review/practice: Propogation and Delegation</p>
