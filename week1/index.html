        <h2>Doing Stuff with Web Things - Local Storage</h2>
        <p>This was good review. Nothing stands out as new for me though.</p>
        <h2>Master Mobile UX Video</h2>
        <p>Highlights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mobile devices dominate the market. You replace them more often. You have more per household.</li>
            <li>Designing for the smallest device first makes it easy to scale up.</li>
            <li>Responsive does not equal mobile first.</li>
            <li>Be there. Be useful. Be quick.</li>
            <li>Design with reachability in mind. Put important things closer to the bottom. (Like menus.)</li>
            <li>Mobile design needs to run fast otherwise people won't stick around. Reduce image size and optimize css and js.</li>
            <li>Only include necessary information. Keep things simple and compact.</li>
            <li>Stop using pop-ups and pop-overs!!!</li>
        </ul>
