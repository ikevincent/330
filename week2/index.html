    <h1>Week 2 Readings</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 2: Programming Basics</h2>
    <p>This has been review. Nothing of note for me here.</p>
    <h2>Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
    <p>Also review. Nothing of note for me here.</p>
    <h2> Chapter 4: Functions</h2>
    <p>Mostly review except for the section on Callbacks which doesn't feel familiar.</p>
    <ul>Callbacks:</ul>
    <li>A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.</li>
    <li>It says you can 'make functions more flexible' when you use them by adding a callback parameter. I don't fully understand what that means.</li>
    <li>You can create anonymous functions as callbacks in one-off situations but it's not recommended. It's usually better to keep them seperate and named.</li>
    <li>Making a note to add more to this section as I learn and research a bit more on this topic over the next couple weeks.</li>
