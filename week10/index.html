    <h1>Week 10 Readings</h1>
    <h2>MDN: Validating Forms</h2>
    <p>Form validation is the process used to ensure that data entered into forms is in the format required. There are
        two types of validation: Client-side and server-side. Client-side is done in the browser while server-side is of
        course done in the server.</p>
    <p>There are three main reasons to validate data entered into forms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We want the right data in the right form.</li>
        <li>We want to protect the user's data.</li>
        <li>We want to protect our website. (Never trust data passed to your server from the client.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are built-in form validation that can be added to form attributes. Required, minlength, maxlength, min,
        max, type, and pattern.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>required: specifies whether the field needs to be filled in before it can be submitted.</li>
        <li>minlength and maxlength: specifies the minimum and maximum length of string data.</li>
        <li>min and max: specifies the minimum and maximum length of numbers.</li>
        <li>type: specifies what type the data should be. (Text, email, number, etc.)</li>
        <li>pattern: specifies a regular expression that defines the pattern expected in a field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Validating with JavaScript</p>
    <p>You can use the Constraint Validation API</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTMLButtonElement (represents a <button> element)</li>
        <li>HTMLFieldSetElement (represents a <fieldset> element)</li>
        <li>HTMLInputElement (represents an <input> element)</li>
        <li>HTMLOutputElement (represents an <output> element)</li>
        <li>HTMLSelectElement (represents a <select> element)</li>
        <li>HTMLTextAreaElement (represents a <textarea> element)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>MDN: Using Fetch</h2>
    <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the protocol, 
        such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, 
        logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.</p>
    <p>Adding this example of uploading a file for later use:</p>
    <p>I wanted to save those bits of code to remember them in case I need them the final few weeks.</p>
    <p>Outside of these parts of fetch I think I'm getting the hang of it.</p>
